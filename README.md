Some exercices are better than an initiation course

# Exercice1:(sum67)
==>With 1 loop
Return the sum of the numbers in the array, except ignore sections of numbers starting with a 6 and extending to the next 7 (every 6 will be followed by at least one 7). Return 0 for no numbers.

# Exercice2:(centered_average)
==>With 1 loop
Return the "centered" average of an array of ints, which we'll say is the mean average of the values, except ignoring the largest and smallest values in the array. If there are multiple copies of the smallest value, ignore just one copy, and likewise for the largest value. Use int division to produce the final average. You may assume that the array is length 3 or more.

# Exercice3:(big_diff)
==>With 1 loop
Given an array length 1 or more of ints, return the difference between the largest and smallest values in the array. Note: the built-in min(v1, v2) and max(v1, v2) functions return the smaller or larger of two values.

# Exercice4:(make_bricks)
==>With no loops
We want to make a row of bricks that is goal inches long. We have a number of small bricks (1 inch each) and big bricks (5 inches each). Return True if it is possible to make the goal by choosing from the given bricks. This is a little harder than it looks and can be done without any loops
